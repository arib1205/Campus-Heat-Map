# Campus-Heat-Map
Created an Android app which provides a dynamic, real-time heat map showing where student crowds are on campus at any time. Deployed beacons around buildings to serve as a physical web which with an Android App and a node server reports presence of students in an area. 

Developed using ARM Mbed, Android, Eddy Stone Beacons, NodeJS and MQTT protocol
